# PHONEGAP Bootstrap Template

The objective is create features in HTML5 like on native mobile. Considering on performance or beauty.

## Why?

With advances in technology and more and more smartphones with high performance, i want to create similar functionality with native and totally unique features for current and future use. I find it very difficult to choose only one of the various alternatives for the reasons of:

* Customization
* Scope of features
* Performance
* Unique features

I want to create awesome apps with balance in high performance and beauty, or one or another. And this is will be my collection of features to achieve that.

## Features

* Section, Nav 
* Tabs
* Buttons, group buttons
* List, block list
* Image 
* Modal
* Toggle button
* Select
* Checkbox button
* Radio button
* Range
* Slide
* Calendar

## Some objectives

* Template columns. (Like on Twitter Bootstrap with rows, col-lg-*, etc..)
* Little coupling with other libraries and frameworks. (let the people to choose what they want)
* Features such as to select number or a calendar.
* Create features with high performance.
* Create features with awesome beauty.
* Power to choose between performance or beauty.
